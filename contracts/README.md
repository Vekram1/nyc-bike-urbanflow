# Contract fixtures

This directory documents and anchors contract fixtures for tiles, policy, and
ingestion outputs. Fixtures live under `fixtures/` with checksums and small,
reviewable datasets. Deterministic tests reference these fixtures to prevent
silent contract drift.

Current fixtures:
- `fixtures/gbfs/*`
- `fixtures/trips/*`
- `fixtures/tiles/*`
- `fixtures/policy/*`
